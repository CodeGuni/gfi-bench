# GFI-Bench - Benchmark to Resolve Real-World Issues Labeled with Good-First-Issue in Open Source Projects

## Problem Statement

Onboarding contributors to a new open-source repository or community presents a significant challenge. The typical approach involves starting with small, beginner-friendly issues labeled as `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`. However, the success rate of resolving these issues and submitting pull requests (PRs) is alarmingly low, with a completion ratio of less than 5%. Most newcomers who commit to resolving issues disappear without asking questions or seeking assistance.

## Solution

To address this issue, we propose the development of an AI assistant designed to guide newcomers through the process of understanding the codebase and resolving issues. This AI companion will:

- **Utilize a large language model (LLM)** to analyze the issue and its context.
- **Break down the problem-solving process** into manageable steps.
- **Generate detailed, actionable, and customized guidance** for each issue.

By offering tailored support, this AI assistant will aim to improve the onboarding experience for new contributors.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to increase the PR completion ratio from less than 5% to at least 50% by:

- Simplifying the process of understanding codebases.
- Offering practical, step-by-step guidance for resolving issues.
- Reducing the intimidation barrier for new contributors.

## Features

- **Issue Analysis**: The AI analyzes each labeled issue to understand its context and requirements.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Customized, step-by-step solutions for each identified issue.
- **Knowledge Gap Reduction**: Supports newcomers by offering explanations and solutions in an accessible way.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration into existing open-source communities and repositories.
